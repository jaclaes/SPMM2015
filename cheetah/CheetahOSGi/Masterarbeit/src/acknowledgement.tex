\noindent I would like to thank my supervisor, \textbf{Priv.-Doz. Dr. Barbara Weber}, for her
encouragement, support and feedback from the initial to the final level. Her valuable guidance and advices enabled
the development of the powerful Component Framework and therewith the completion of this thesis.

\bigskip \noindent Furthermore, I want to thank all people who detected shortcomings within the
thesis as well as the implemented framework. Special thank goes to \textbf{Mathias Breuﬂ} who based
his bachelor thesis on the Component Framework and therefore provided valuable feedback and ideas
for improvement.

\bigskip \noindent Last but not least I want to thank \textbf{my familiy} and \textbf{my girlfriend}
for their appreciation and their continuous support during the entire study. They cheered me up in
hard times and celebrated the achieved milestones, which made them more valuable for me.
