<title>The Process of Process Modeling</title>

<h1>The Process of Process Modeling</h1>
<p align="justify">The process of process modeling can be described as an iterative and highly flexible 
  process [1, 2, 3] that can be divided into three phases [4]. According to [1] and consistent 
  with [3, 5], the creation of conceptual models comprises the context of discovery 
  and the context of justification. In the context of discovery, modelers both try 
  to understand the requirements and shape the process model by inserting elements and 
  deleting elements from the process model. The context of justification, in turn, involves 
  the validation of the created artifact against modeling guidelines and the requirements 
  for creating the model. When creating a process model switching between the context 
  of discovery and the context of justification occurs resulting in an alternation of solution 
  generation and solution verification [1, 3, 5]. In both contexts, discovery and 
  justification, a modeler will interact with a model in different ways. These interactions, 
  in turn, can be observed on the syntactic level of the semiotic ladder [6] and constitute 
  an operational view on the process of process modeling comprising the three successive 
phases of comprehension, modeling, and reconciliation as follows:</p>
<h3> Comprehension</h3>
<p align="justify">In the comprehension phase modelers try to understand the requirements 
  to be modeled as well as the model that has been created so far. Consequently, 
  working memory is filled with the knowledge extracted from the requirements and, 
  if available, from the process model itself. By utilizing superior knowledge organization
  techniques more information can be stored in working memory [2]. The 
  information chunks stored in working memory during the comprehension phase are 
  subsequently used in the modeling phase to create the actual process model.</p>
<h3>  Modeling</h3>
<p align="justify">The modeler uses the information acquired and stored in working memory 
  during the previous comprehension phase to now change the process model. If the 
  modeler was able to aggregate information to higher level chunks and store it in working 
  memory, more modeling steps can be executed in the modeling phase before being
  forced to revisit the requirements for acquiring more information. Therefore, we would assume that the number of changes made to the process model without revisiting the 
  requirements is influenced by a process modeler's experience due to the aggregation of 
  information to higher level chunks [2] and the superior extraction of information from 
  requirements [7]. Additional factors influencing the number of modeling steps include
  familiarity with the modeling notation and usability of the modeling tool [2].</p>
<h3>  Reconciliation </h3>
<p align="justify">After the modeling phase, modelers utilize the process model's secondary 
  notation (e.g., notation of layout, typographic cues) to enhance the process 
  model's understandability [8, 9]. Additionally, improvements in the process model's 
  secondary notation support the comprehension phase of a subsequent iteration, as the 
  process model becomes more comprehensible for the modeler when coming back to
  it [8]. In particular, during the subsequent comprehension phase the modeler has to 
  identify the part of the model to work on next. A better laid-out model helps identifying 
  a suitable area of the model, causing less distraction and therefore enables the modeler 
  to store more information in working memory that can be incorporated in the process 
  model. It has to be emphasized that more experienced modelers either place elements 
  correctly or make use of secondary notation to keep complexity at a manageable level. 
  Additionally, the factual use of secondary notation is subject to the modeler's personal
  style [8].</p>
<h2>Data Analysis</h2>
<p align="justify">We analyzed the processes of process modeling of 26 students, using Cheetah Experimental Platform. For 
  all models, we computed several metrics that capture the characteristics of the modeling 
  processes based on the identified comprehension, modeling, and reconciliation 
  phases. The processes were 
  divided into modeling iterations. One iteration is assumed to comprise a comprehension 
  (C), modeling (M), and reconciliation (R) phase in this respective order. We then 
  analyzed how closely the process followed the pattern of iterations of CMR-phases, and 
  compared how iterations vary within a single process and between different processes.
  The iterations of a modeling process were identified by aligning its phases to the CMR pattern. 
  If a certain phase of this pattern was not present in the modeling process, the 
  respective phase is skipped for the observed iteration and the process continues with the 
next phase of the pattern.</p>
<h3>Modeling: Chunk Size</h3>
<p align="justify"> Following the argumentation in Sect. 2.1, modelers can be
  assumed to conduct modeling with knowledge chunks of different sizes. We quantify
  chunk size as the average number of create and delete operations executed in one iteration;
  we observed chunk sizes between 2.65 and 8.5 with an average of 4.6. Chunk
  size is inversely proportional to the number of iterations as all subjects were
  modeling the same process with a fixed set of elements. Altogether this measure reflects
  the ability to model large parts of a model without a need to comprehend or reconcile.</p>
  <h3>Reconciliation Breaks </h3>
<p align="justify">A steady process of modeling is assumed to be a sequence of
  iterations following the CMR-pattern. We observed that the R phase was sometimes
  skipped if the modeler could place all model elements directly at the right spot, which
  alleviates the need for reconciliation. However, some processes may even show iterations
  of CR-patterns, i.e., without a modeling phase, where a modeler interrupts the
  common flow of modeling for additional reconciliation. We quantify this aspect by the
  relative share of iterations that comprise unexpected reconciliation (without modeling)
out of all iterations; we observed values between 0% and 45% with an average of 12%.</p>
<h3>Share of Comprehension </h3>
<p align="justify">In comprehension phases requirements are extracted and
  organized towards a process model, which are then formalized in modeling phases.
  Hence, differences in the amount of time spent on comprehension can be expected to
  characterize modeling strategies and to impact on the modeling result. We quantify this
  aspect as the ratio of the average length of a comprehension phase in a process to the
  average length of an iteration. We observed values
  of comprehension time between 32% and 75% with an average of 55% of the overall 
  length of an iteration.</p>
