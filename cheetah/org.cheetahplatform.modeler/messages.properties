Pu_1=Process models are more difficult to create without the modelling method.
Pu_2=The modelling method allows me to create the model faster.
Pu_3=Using the modelling method facilitates labelling (i.e., giving a name to) the BPMN elements.
Pu_4=Using the modelling method makes it harder for me to  find the relevant ontology concept that I want to label.
Pu_5=Overall, I find the modelling method useful for BPMN model creation. 
PEOU_1=I make errors more often when I am modelling with the modelling method.
PEOU_2=Using the modelling method during modelling is frustrating.
PEOU_3=Using the method during modelling requires a lot of mental effort.
PEOU_4=Overall, I find the modelling method easy to use during modelling.
