HPFMTutorialDialog_6=Please read the technique tutorial case description. Then, follow the upcoming instructions within the interactive tutorial to familiarize yourself with a new modeling technique. In this tutorial you will be guided to solve the case step by step.
HPFMTutorialStep1_0=Add the start node and the activity "Take Order". Connect with a sequence flow.
HPFMTutorialStep2_0=Then, two options exist. Add an XOR gateway.
HPFMTutorialStep3_0=First model the happy path. Most orders are under 1.000. In that case, standard delivery is selected.
HPFMTutorialStep4_0=Next, finish first this path by adding closing activities and end event.
HPFMTutorialStep5_0=Only then, finish the > 1.000 flow. Again, the path is split for two parallel activities. There is no happy path, so model the whole construction of two parallel activities at once.
HPFMTutorialStep6_0=Add the remaining delivery selection activity and connect to the closing XOR gateway.

SPMTutorialStep1_0=Add the start node and the activity "Take Order". Connect with a sequence flow.
SPMTutorialStep2_0=Then, two options exist. Add an XOR gateway.
SPMTutorialStep3_0=Model one of the two optional paths. Add standard delivery selection activity and closing XOR gateway.
SPMTutorialStep4_0=Now first add the other optional path before you finish the rest of the model. Again, the path is split for two parallel activities. First complete the block of two parallel paths before you model the rest of this optional path.
SPMTutorialStep5_0=Only then, add the activity for fast delivery selection and connect to the closing XOR gateway.
SPMTutorialStep6_0=Only then, finish the rest of the model.
