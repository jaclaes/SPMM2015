----All events are executed - start with expiration of events.
Expiration is done by executing some routes -> Triggers Event Service, which removes the expired events.

Event2 was valid for only 61 minutes and was triggered after 30 minutes -> should be expired now
-> Nevertheless the values of Climbing should be changed as Event3 is still valid and Event3 was triggered after Event2
