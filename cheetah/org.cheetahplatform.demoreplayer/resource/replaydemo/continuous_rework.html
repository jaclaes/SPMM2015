<h1>Continuous Rework
</h1>
<p align="justify"> After a long initial comprehension phase, the diagram shows alternating modeling and reconciliation phases until reaching a 'plateau' of comprehension and reconciliation
phases. While the remainder of this process comprises some modeling phases, it 
remains dominated by long comprehension and reconciliation phases. In comparison to 
the previous example, this phase diagram is rather flat and unsteady. </p>

<h2>Measures</h2>
<p>Our measures classify this process as showing a low chunk size (3) with 
  a medium number of iterations (18). Moreover, the measures show a high number of
  reconciliation breaks (38.5%), i.e., modeling iterations that show unexpected reconciliation.
  This example shows an average score with respect to time spent on comprehension
  (56.6%).</p>
<h2> Modeling Strategy</h2>
<p>The replay confirms the observation that the model is created very
  slowly; adding new elements is directly followed by layouting, i.e., a reconciliation
  phase. Extensive layouting also happens prior to adding new elements in order to prepare
  a certain area of the model for adaptation. Furthermore, reconciliation often affects
  large parts of the existing model beyond the elements added last. We characterize this
  strategy as 'continuous rework'.
</p>
<h2>Modeling Result</h2>
<p>The created model is free of syntax errors, but shows a deadlock
  since a merging of multiple branches is not implemented correctly. The modeling result
  approximates the expected modeling outcome in terms of graph edit distance slightly
better than the average score.</p>
