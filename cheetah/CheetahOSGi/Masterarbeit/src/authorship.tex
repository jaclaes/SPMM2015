\noindent 
I, Felix Schöpf Bakk.techn., declare that this thesis and the work
presented in it are my own. I confirm that:

\begin{itemize} 
	\item[\tiny{$\blacksquare$}] This work was done wholly while in
candidature for a research degree at this University.
 
	\item[\tiny{$\blacksquare$}] No part of this thesis has previously
	been submitted for a degree or any other qualification at this University or any other
institution.
 
	\item[\tiny{$\blacksquare$}] Where I have consulted the published work of
others, this is always clearly attributed.

	\item[\tiny{$\blacksquare$}] Where I have quoted from the work of others, the
source is always given. With the exception of such quotations, this thesis is
entirely my own work.
 
	\item[\tiny{$\blacksquare$}] I have acknowledged all main sources of help.
 
	\item[\tiny{$\blacksquare$}] Where the thesis is based on work done by myself
jointly with others, I have made clear exactly what was done by others and what I
have contributed myself.
\end{itemize}
