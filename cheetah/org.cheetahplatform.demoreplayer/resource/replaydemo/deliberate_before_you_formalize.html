<h1>Deliberate Before You Formalize</h1>
<div align="justify">The phase diagram depicted below shows a rather long initial comprehension phase after which alternating comprehension
  and modeling phases can be observed. All modeling phases are very long and
  steep, i.e., much model content is added per iteration. Virtually no reconciliation can be
  observed. </div>

<h2>Measuress</h2>
<div align="justify">This process as showing
  a large chunk size (7.63) and a low number of iterations (8). We do not observe
  reconciliation breaks. The share of time spent on comprehension is relatively small at
  38% (note that our specific measure neglects the first comprehension phase). </div>
<h2>Modeling Strategy</h2>
<div align="justify">Replaying the modeling process using Cheetah Experimental Platform shows that the modeler
  appears to have a clear conception of the model to be created. Elements are placed on
  the canvas in large chunks, while all elements are being placed to appropriate positions
  so that no movement of elements is required.We characterize this strategy as 'deliberate
  before you formalize'. </div>
<h2>Modeling Result</h2>
<div align="justify">The created model is free of syntax errors and behavioral anomalies,
  such as deadlocks. But due to some superfluous activities, there is an average approximation 
  of the expected modeling outcome in terms of graph edit distance.</div>
