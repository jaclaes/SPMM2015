ExpertModelingTwoModelingTasksExperiment_3=Overall, I am very familiar with the BPMN.
ExpertModelingTwoModelingTasksExperiment_30=How many work days of self education have you made within the last 12 months? (This includes e.g. learning-by-doing, learning-on-the-fly, self-study of textbooks or specifications)
